# -Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project tackles the important challenge of predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using clinical data. It's a real-world binary classification problem that applies several ML algorithms to improve healthcare insights.

🚀 Objective
To develop and compare machine learning models that predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical features.

🧠 Models Implemented
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Neural Network (using Keras/TensorFlow)

🗂️ Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Training

Performance Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Keras / TensorFlow
